After a few requests to share recipes for some of the food I've cooked, here they are. 

No food photography or blogging just reasonably straightforward vegetarian fare. Recipes shared here are rarely "my own". They're typically variations on a theme, combining several similar dishes I've cooked before or incorporate
a few simple tweaks I've picked up over the years. 

Hope you find something appetising :)
