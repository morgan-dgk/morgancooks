# Veggie Spag Bol (Spaghetti Bolognaise) 

## Ingredients

 * 1 large brown onion, diced 
 * 2 large garlic cloves, diced
 * 1 medium carrot, diced
 * 1 can diced tomatoes (avoid using crushed tomatoes - these typically have added tomato juice)
 * 2 tbsp tomato paste (1 sachets worth here in Aus)
 * 1 cheese rind (just the butt!); preferably hard sharp cheese like parmesean / grand padano etc. 
 * pinch chilli flakes
 * olive oil
 * 1/3 cup black lentils; use 1/2 a cup for a 'meatier' pasta sauce.

## Instructions

1. Saute the carrot and onion + a pinch of salt in olive oil on medium heat until softened, about 5 minutes.
2. Add the garlic and chilli flakes, and cook for an additional minute, stirring frequently. 
3. Add the tomato paste and cook for about a minute, stirring frequently. 
4. Add the canned tomatoes, lentils, cheese rind and 1 cup of water + a good pinch salt. 
5. Cook until lentils reach desired texture, approximately 20-30 minutes. You may need to add additional water to the pan to prevent sticking as the lentils absorb the water during cooking.

Serve hot and enjoy :)
