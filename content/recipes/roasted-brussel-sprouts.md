Don't let anyone ever tell you brussel sprouts are gross. My favourite quick and easy comfort food.

## Ingredients

 * 400g brussel sprouts, ends removed
 * Maple syrup 
 * Hommus
 * Dukah (optional)
 * 1 Lemon
 * olive oil

## Instructions

1. In a medium sized bowl, mix brussel sprouts with a good glug of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt.  
2. Preheat oven to 160c (if using air fryer, preheat at 80c for 5 mins) 
3. Roast low and slow for about 30 minutes. The sprouts should be a deep brown colour on the outside and very soft on the inside. 
4. Squeeze half a lemon's worth of juice over all the cooked sprouts.
5. With 1tbsp of hommus, do the fancy chef thing with the back of a spoon to create a thick smear of hommus on each plate.
6. Place the sprouts on top of the hommus, drizzle with a small amount of maple syrup to offset the richness of the sprouts. 
7. Finish with a sprinkle of Dukah.

For a more substantial meal, service with your choice of carbs + some greens. I often use quinoa and rocket.

Savour.
