## Ingredients

 * About 400g fresh green beans - topped, tailed and halved
 * 1/3 of a cup black lentils (any lentil which remains firm when cooked can be subbed, e.g. brown lentils)
 * 1 can of good quality diced tomatoes
 * 2 tbsp tomato paste (1 can)
 * 4 large cloves of garlic
 * One large onion, thinly sliced
 * Dried chilli flakes
 * Olive Oil 
 * 1 tsp Harissa paste (optional)
 * Unsweetened coconut yoghurt (optional, to garnish)

## Instructions

1. Add olive oil, sliced onion and a pinch of salt to the pan (this sweats the onions and prevents them burning). Saute on medium-low heat for about 5 mins, stirring occasionally.
2. While the onion is cooking, chop the garlic cloves. 
3. Add the garlic, a pinch of chilli flakes, and harissa (if using) to the pan and saute for another minute until fragrant.
4. Add the tomato paste and stir to combine. Saute for another minute stirring frequently. Sauteing the tomate paste removes the excess sweetness. 
5. Add the chopped green beans and stir to combine. Saute for 5 mins to soften beans.
6. Add the diced tomatoes, lentils and 1 cup of water. Combine
7. Bring to a simmer and let cook for about 30 minutes. You may need to add some additional water as the lentils cook. When cooked the green beans should be very soft, but not mushy.  

Serve with the carbs of your choice and a dollop of the coconut yoghurt.
