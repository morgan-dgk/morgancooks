	   "content": "Miso Butter Broccoli w/ Simple Sweet Corn Salad Ingredients For the Miso Butter Broccoli:\n1 large head of broccoli, cut into bite-sized florets 1 tbsp butter, softened 2 tsp white miso paste 1/4 lime or lemon Olive Oil For the Sweet Corn Salad:\n1/2 wombok / nappa cabbage 1 large corn cob Dressing of choice (Kewpie sesame dressing slaps) Instructions To prepare the sweet corn salad:\nRemove the husk of the corn cob if present. Place the whole cob in a pot of lightly salted boiling water and boil for 3-5 minutes or until the corn is bright yellow and tender. Shred the wombok to the best of your ability. Allow corn to cool slightly then remove corn kernels from cob (a little tricky, google a video on how to do so safely). Combine corn and shred cabbage; toss to combine. To prepare the miso butter broccoli:\nPreheat oven to 220c. If using a fan-forced oven or air fryer preheat to 200c. Place broccoli florets on oven dish / in air fryer basket. Drizzle with olive oil (a small glug\u0026rsquo;s worth) and add a pinch of salt. Toss to combine. Roast for approximately 15 minutes or until the tips of broccoli is golden brown. Meanwhile, combine butter and miso paste in a small bowl and mash with a fork to combine. The texture does not need to be uniform as it should melt when combined with the warm broccoli. Once broccoli is roasted, add the miso butter to the broccoli and toss to combine. Finish by adding juice of the lime or lemon. Adjust salt and citrus to taste. Serve hot and enjoy :)\n"
